      <h1>Equality</h1>
      <p>The inference rules we’ve seen so far for dealing with conjunction, disjunction, and implication all operate on judgements. But as it happens, we’ve got some extra simple judgements for dealing with “values”. To be precise, the <em>values</em> our logic knows about are just simply typed lambda expressions. We’ll talk more about lambda expressions later. For now all we need to do is see how we can manipulate them in logic. There are two ways, and the first – <em>equality</em> – is the subject of this page.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are lambda expressions, then <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> is the simple judgement asserting that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are equal. We take equality of lambda expressions to be an undefined concept governed precisely by its inference rules.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>-intro rule is simple enough to state: every lambda expression is equal to itself, and this does not require evidence. Lower case latin characters like <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> will always represent expression variables.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{c}
       \\ \hline
 x = x
\end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>-elimination rule, <code>eq-elim</code>, encapsulates the idea of <em>substituting equals for equals</em>, and is a special form. Its tableau looks like this.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ccc}
x = y &amp;                &amp; P[z \mapsto x] \\ \hline
      &amp; P[z \mapsto y] &amp;
\end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>We interpret this rule as follows: <span class="math inline">\(P[z \mapsto e]\)</span> represents a judgement <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> after the substitution <span class="math inline">\(z \mapsto e\)</span> has been applied, where <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is an expression variable and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> an expression. To check an invocation of this rule, we need four things: the variable <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> being substituted for, the judgement <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> being substituted into, the equality <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>, and the judgement <span class="math inline">\(P[z \mapsto x]\)</span>. Let’s see an example of <code>eq-elim</code> in action by proving that equality is symmetric.</p>
<pre class="mycelium"><code>theorem eq-sym
if
  * x == y
then
  * y == x

proof
1. x == x : eq-intro
2. x == y : assumption 1
3. y == x : eq-elim z (z == x); 2, 1</code></pre>
<p>Note how the dummy variable <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> doesn’t actually appear in the judgements of the proof; it’s just an artifact of <code>eq-elim</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s another example: equality is transitive.</p>
<pre class="mycelium"><code>theorem eq-trans
if
  * x == y
  * y == z
then
  * x == z

proof
1. y == z : assumption 2
2. x == y : assumption 1
3. x == z : eq-elim w (x == w); 1, 2</code></pre>
<p>A very clear and common method of proof, especially in algebra, is the <em>equation chain</em>. Say we have two things, <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span>, and want to show that they are equal. One way to do this is to exhibit a chain of things <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_3\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(E_{n-1}\)</span> and show that <span class="math inline">\(E_1 = E_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(E_2 = E_3\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(E_{n-1} = E_n\)</span>. Doing this in raw natural deduction is a little cumbersome compared to the way we’d write such a proof informally, because we have to explicitly invoke transitivity or eq-elim for each link in the chain. However, the sequence of these invocations follows a simple pattern.</p>
<p>Our proof checker understands an alternative syntax just for equation chains like this. Lets see an example.</p>
<pre class="mycelium"><code>theorem eq-trans-3
if
  * x == y
  * y == z
  * z == w
then
  * x == w

proof
1. x : chain
    == y : assumption 1
    == z : assumption 2
    == w : assumption 3</code></pre>
<p>The syntax condenses an equation chain to a single “line” in the proof, where each equality is annotated with just its own justification. The entire line reduces to the statement that <span class="math inline">\(x = w\)</span>. We can’t refer back to individual equalities in the chain, but that is almost never necessary anyway. The full story behind equation chains is a little more complicated than this example demonstrates, but we’re not ready to see the full power of equation chains yet. Suffice it to say for now that each successive <code>==</code> line in the proof for <code>eq-trans-3</code> gets expanded to about 4 lines of raw natural deduction that would otherwise require jumping around to follow.</p>
