The first time that you glance at them, the woods are mysterious.

You stand at the tree line, from a field, and you look out into an army of trunks and branches and leaves that goes into darkness. And there's no way to know where that ends and what is inside there.

But to a certain type of person it is fascinating.

And they walk along the edge of that woods and they hear things and they eventually venture inside and look at the dangers and the glories of what that forest has to offer.

And one day they get to the other end of that forest and back and they've built a path and they've run into paths that have been made by others and after a while the forest is just another known entity. And they look at this whole world that once was mysterious and dark and strange and it can all be knocked down into a scientific pile of classifications and declarations and numbers.

And people will look at it once it's this dull spreadsheet and they'll say "why did you care about it?" because they never stood at the edge of that tree line and wondered what the darkness held.

This is an experiment.

An astonishingly beautiful constellation of ideas, developed by many people over the last 80 years or so, make it possible to think of programming as an algebraic activity. Or mathematics as a mechanical activity. Or logic as a computational activity.

The main ingredients are natural deduction (1920s), lambda calculus (1930s), type inference (1970s), and a little bit of category theory (1940s-60s). The basic idea is that simply typed lambda calculus is a really great model of computation, being both simple and powerful. It fits nicely into the framework of natural deduction over first order logic with equality. Extended with some categorical ideas, this framework includes the so-called _inductive_ objects like natural numbers and lists as well.

Taken together, these ideas make it possible to develop a nice chunk of mathematics where (1) all proofs are mechanically checked, (2) all theorems are constructive, and (3) algorithms can be _calculated_ and thought of as _solutions to systems of equations_. And none of this in an ad-hoc, language dependent way, but very naturally.

On these pages we're going to take these simple and old ideas and try to see where they can go.
